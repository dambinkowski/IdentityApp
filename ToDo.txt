#       TO DO        # 

+ test if django is running 
+ add apps to settngis 
+ structure url 
+ create url files 
+ home page, url, view, html 
+ make migrations to add apps 


+ API 
+ profile identity variants 

+ request send 
+ create method 
valiadet data 
{'receiver': {'username': 'Michael'}, 'request_reasoning': 'how you doin'}
i need to access username to put it to creation 
okay with update had to go back, and create extra field
because I don't want to be able to update receiver becaues then that would relate 
to links etc. 
now serializer is different 
okay i give up I am gonna use generic view for this part
there is so much logic that might as well 
redoing keep viewsets for profile identity variants 
but for requests I am going to explicitly set 
+ request / send / get list - post new 
+ request / send / {pk} / - get detials, put update delete 
- add list of request identity variants 
because of separation between sender and receiver
i can make serializer with link for sender to be read only for safety 

+ request / send / {pk} / 
- update method 
uperantly using roture i need 
- request received
i want to add documentiatno since I am moving away from 
roture, I liked how links were shown, so I want to see 
documentiation, I was going to use swagger because it sometihng I was learnig 
at the coures, but then when reading OpenAPI documentiatno,  I 
checked django documentiatn for documenting api 
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/
and I found recomandation for drf-spectacular so I am gonnat try that 
pip install drf-spectacular 
https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html

i was about to start web but then decided to create tests 
so when something doesnt work on website i know its not the 
backend issue 

when doing tests, i craetd user in setup, then i craete test case 
for sucselful registration, and i couldnt' understand why i am keep getitng error
manually it works, then i use print method for error msg to realzie that 
user already exits in setup because username has to be unique 

i spend so much time already writing tests, i had more errors writing tests wrong then
the app i was thinknig if there is some automatic testing 
i found schematics but then I realize, tests i wanted to make
are very specific, user action or app logic specific 
what is the input and what the result should be 
so I went back to writing them myself... 


okay making tests 
i realized that often is 404 for not found instead of unathoridez of forbidden, becasuse 
I use safety by not allowing user to ever be able to write a sender as input when creating the request 
or accesing request where sender 
I realzied my issue was that it return empty set 
deep dive into why is it empty set [] 200ok, then reading how it runs global permissions not object permission 
then i decided to leave it 

so i discovered has_object_permission only runs on Retrive/Update/Destroy, 
I thought when I am setting permission on the object any action with this object only permission allows to ever view it 
but list does not work like that, it does only check global has_permission, so to protect the view, 
filter what query set should return, and only filter data will show, so if user is trying 
to find something using pk, and I add filetr, that user has to be X it will return 404, because 
there is no match for that, but its not there is something like that but you don't have access to it 
I wonder if i should do explicit, user gave this pk for request,
its different then I first assumed but I guess it does make sense, I did start to research how to make 
forbidden, by adding some logic, then decided to stick to default, jus tests are going to be different with 
no found , or empty set, but again as long as data is invisible, and it has approach that 
- its not:  server has the resource you don't have access to it 
its 
- not of the resource that you have access too has those parameters
