#       TO DO        # 

+ test if django is running 
+ add apps to settngis 
+ structure url 
+ create url files 
+ home page, url, view, html 
+ make migrations to add apps 


+ API 
+ profile identity variants 

+ request send 
+ create method 
valiadet data 
{'receiver': {'username': 'Michael'}, 'request_reasoning': 'how you doin'}
i need to access username to put it to creation 
okay with update had to go back, and create extra field
because I don't want to be able to update receiver becaues then that would relate 
to links etc. 
now serializer is different 
okay i give up I am gonna use generic view for this part
there is so much logic that might as well 
redoing keep viewsets for profile identity variants 
but for requests I am going to explicitly set 
+ request / send / get list - post new 
+ request / send / {pk} / - get detials, put update delete 
- add list of request identity variants 
because of separation between sender and receiver
i can make serializer with link for sender to be read only for safety 

+ request / send / {pk} / 
- update method 
uperantly using roture i need 
- request received

- request variants
